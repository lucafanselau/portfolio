        Welcome to my website, I am glad you found your way here! This
        landingpage is an interactive experience designed as my Portfolio. If
        you want a more structured and static overview or if this webpage causes
        trouble with your device, you can checkout the{" "}
        <Link className={"link"} href={"/about"}>
          About
        </Link>{" "}
        page. In the second case I would be happy if you could report the issue
        to me. Either via{" "}
        <Link className={"link"} href={"mailto:" + config.mail}>
          E-Mail
        </Link>
        , or directly in the{" "}
        <Link className={"link"} target={"_blank"} href={config.projectGithub}>
          Github Repository
        </Link>
      </P>
      <P>
        If you decided to stay here, let's start by exploring the space... It
        still a bit empty here, but that will change very soon. Otherwise you
        can also checkout my social media profiles, which are linked in the
        toolbar.
      </P>

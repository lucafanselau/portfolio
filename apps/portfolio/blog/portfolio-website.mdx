# Test thing for a blog

this is a testing text and i am currently checking how fast i can type but it turns out the limiting factor seems to be the speed at which i form this sentence. not really though i am still a slow typer... it has become better though


- list item 1
- list item 2
- list item 3
- list item 1

```ts title
import { abc } from "def";

const a = abc();

while (b < 0) {
	return abc()();
}
```
